1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 (3... d6 4. c3 f5 5. d3 Qf6 {is what Dubov played
last round against Fedoseev with black! This guy is truly a creative and
imaginative player!}) 4. c3 Nf6 5. d4 (5. d3 {Is what we would mostly expect to
see these days, the quiet Italian}) 5... exd4 6. b4!? {What is this?? A delayed
Evans Gambit??} (6. e5 d5 {is what one would expect to see here}) 6... Bb6 7. e5
Ne4 (7... d5 {should probably be played like in the mainline. Did Dubov have
something up his sleeve with the inclusion of b4 and Bb6?}) 8. Bd5 Nxc3 9. Nxc3
dxc3 10. Bg5 {Novelty...white is getting nice development for the pawns} 10...
Ne7 (10... f6 {looks suicidal opening up lines towards the king. Also never play
f6 like Ben Finegold says!}) 11. O-O h6 12. Bh4 O-O (12... g5 {this looks
critical but Karjakin must have feared his opponents preparation here!} 13. Bg3
{is probably the most solid option here, white regains the pawn on c3 and it's
not clear where black will find shelter for this king.} (13. Nxg5 Nxd5 14. Nf3
{could be really messy with compensation for the piece})) 13. Re1 Qe8 {...d6
wasn't possible so Karjakin at least unpins the knight} 14. Bb3 a5 15. Bf6
{really putting the screws on the black kingside....It's hard to feel
comfortable here with black!} 15... a4 {please get of the diagonal, pretty
please} 16. Bc4 {nope} 16... Ng6 17. Qd3 d5 {finally getting the bishop
out...but at what cost?} 18. exd6 Be6 19. Qxg6!! {a stunning positional Queen
sacrifice!} 19... fxg6 20. Rxe6 Qf7 21. Bxc3 (21. Re4 {is too early, black comes
up ahead} 21... gxf6 22. Bxf7+ Rxf7) 21... Kh8 22. Re4 Qf5 23. Re7 {now g7 is a
big problem!} 23... Rg8 24. Bxg8 Rxg8 25. dxc7 {that's a big pawn!} 25... Qc2
26. Be5 Bxf2+ 27. Kh1 {White is so completely winning now that Dubov can take
his time with moves like h3 and Kh2 before doing anything, it's stunning how
badly Karjakin is crusehd in this game} 27... Bb6 28. h3 Kh7 29. Re1 a3 30. Kh2
g5 31. Nd4 Qc4 32. Nf5 Qxb4 33. Rc1 Kg6 34. Rxg7+ Kxf5 35. Rxg8 Bxc7 36. Bxc7
{black couldn't really do much about this inevitable material loss} 36... Qb2
37. Rc5+ Ke4 38. Rd8 {Re5+ and Rf8 is coming with mate or winning the black
queen. Karjakin resigned.} 1-0
