1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 Bg4 {This is a weak move already.-Fischer} 4. dxe5 Bxf3
5. Qxf3 dxe5 6. Bc4 Nf6 7. Qb3 Qe7 8. Nc3 c6 9. Bg5 {Black is in what's like a
zugzwang position here. He can't develop the queen side knight because the pawn
is hanging, the bishop is blocked because of the Queen.-Fischer} 9... b5 10.
Nxb5 {A brilliant sacrifice made by Morphy.} 10... cxb5 11. Bxb5+ Nbd7 12. O-O-O
Rd8 13. Rxd7 Rxd7 {Obviously, black could not capture with the knight, because
it is pinned to the queen by the white bishop at g5. Capturing with the king
would have been illegal, because of the bishop on the other side of the board.
Naturally, if black had catured with queen, the bishop would capture the queen.
So although black has increased the advantage points, with a rook and the knight
opposed by white's bishop and two pawns, the two pins are so strong that the
fate of the game is already sealed.} 14. Rd1 Qe6 {After Morphy brought the
remaining rook to d1 to increase the pressure at d7,black took the opportunity
to break the pin against the knight by moving the queen forward. This also
offers an exchange of queens. Morphy, behind in material, was certainly not
inclined to exchange queens. Instead, he forces his way through checkmate} 15.
Bxd7+ Nxd7 {Black has an extra piece, but Morphy checkmates in two moves. To
achieve this, he will have to take that knight out to finish the job.} 16. Qb8+
$1 {An amazing queen sacrifice that gets the knight to leave the the d file and
removes it from the critical sqares.} 16... Nxb8 17. Rd8# {Black is ahead by a
queen and a knight for 2 pawns but that doesn't matter since he loses to the
ingenious tactical play of Morphy.} 1-0
